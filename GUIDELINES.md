Going forward, I'll:

- Provide clear, direct instructions specifying the terminal type (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Bash).
- Give complete code solutions instead of partial snippets that require piecing together.
- Focus on the simplest approach first before suggesting more complex alternatives.
- Use proper file path formats in all code blocks.
- Avoid making assumptions about your environment setup.
- Always use the file path code block format.
- Include file paths in the code block tags.
- Format code with the language:filepath syntax.
- Ensure code blocks have file paths for easy execution.
