# Communications Plan

- **Daily (async)**: Standup notes in `docs/notes/` (What was done, blocks, next).  
- **Weekly**: Stakeholder review (demo build, metrics, risks).  
- **Channels**: GitHub Issues/Discussions; Email for release notes; Optional WhatsApp group for testers.  
- **Decision log**: `docs/DECISIONS.md` (date, context, decision, alternatives, owner).
