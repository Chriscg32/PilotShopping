# Privacy & Security

- OCR is on-device by default; images are **not** uploaded unless Pro is enabled.  
- Local DB protected by OS encryption; optional app PIN/biometrics.  
- Cloud sync (Pro): TLS in transit; least-privilege tokens; object storage with signed URLs.  
- Data deletion: in-app data wipe; server-side delete endpoint.
